            <p>Today is my first day creating this project. I am very nervous because I am not sure if I understand what I am doing
                and
                 I want to finish this as quickly as possible. Either way, I'm excited to start working and make some progress each
                day

            <h4>3/26/25</h4>
            <p>Today don't have much time to work on the project, so I am going to try to
                just add a little to the site.html and site.css files and make a workable output
                with my flask file
            </p>
            <h5>Accomplishments Today</h5>
            <li>Added to site.html and site.css</li>
            <li>Reorganized Project structure</li>
            <li>Added basic score calculation functions in app.py</li>
            <li>Installed Jinja2 to add more functionality to html files by
                sending them a varible from my python file</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3/27/25</h4>
            <p>Today I learned that I might not be able to just grab the wishlist data from
                users as easily as I wanted to. I originally thought the base Steam Web API's would allow it
                but with more research I have to go to alternate API's for this use case. Other than that, I 
                set up a connection between this project and github, created a place to deploy the project with 
                a domain, and set up a basic connection between site.html and page.html.
            </p>
            <h5>Accomplishments Today</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Connection to GitHub</li>
                <li>Connection to Netlify (deploy and domain)</li>
                <li>Basic html file connection</li>
                <li>Learned more about Steam Web API uses and put it on my google doc</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Goals for Next Time</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure domain is fully prepared and working</li>
                <li>Get basic Steam Web API to work</li>
                <li>Make connection between html files more complicated (button with fun formatting)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I don't have a lot of time to work on this project today but I want to work towards
                accomplishing the goals I set last time. I likely won't finish these goals today 
                but I'll at least put a debt in them.

            <h4>4/04/25</h4>
            <p>I spent a lot of time procrastinating on this project because I felt
                really dumb for not knowing absolutely everything I was doing. I've 
                recently realized that no one in CS truly knows what they are doing 
                so it is ok for me to not completely know, and its even better for me 
                to learn new things while developing this project (which was my original
                intention). Going forward, I will make it a point to at least so something
                with this project everyday, even if its something super basic. Since I'm 
                using things I'm learning on the fly (flask, jinja2, steam web api, api's
                in general, etc), it would be very beneficial for me to work with these 
                systems everyday so the new concpets I learn don't disapear. With that 
                rant done, I want to say that I am feeling more confident with this project
                now. I am understanding Jinja2 and Flask and am using what I know to build
                the project. I still have a lot to do but I'm happy with the progress, I just
                need to continue working everyday.

            <ul>
                <li>Set up Python Code for sorting list of games</li>
                <li>Set up Python/HTML code (Jinja2) to output each game from a list of games and its data</li>
                <li>Acquired a Steam Web API key</li>

            <h5>Goals for Next Time</h5>

                <li>Consider a good use for the buttons</li>
                <li>Get both of my HTMl pages to function together with button(temporarily, will change buttons use later)</li>
                <li>Use Steam Web API to collect Wishlisted Games (used made up games list for testing)</li>

            <h4>4/04/25</h4>
            <p>I'm finding this latest stretch of the project to be most difficult. What I'm 
                trying to do now is connect this python file to my steam account but that is 
                producing an error when running the file. Also the netlify domain isn't 
                working at all so I have to fix that as well. The good news is I updated the 
                code to work with the steam input and I have an idea for the buttons. On the initial
                publishing of the site, the buttons on each html page will connect them to each other,
                allowing users of the site to see these docs. Later on however, I plan to make it so when a 
                user hits the button, they are allowed to enter their steam id so the program 
                will work for them. But that functionality will come later.
