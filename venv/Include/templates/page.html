                <p>Today is my first day creating this project. I am very nervous because I am not sure if I understand what I am doing
                    and
                    I want to finish this as quickly as possible. Either way, I'm excited to start working and make some progress each
                    day
                </p>

            <p>Today don't have much time to work on the project, so I am going to try to
                just add a little to the site.html and site.css files and make a workable output
