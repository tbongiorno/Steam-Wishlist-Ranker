                <p>Today is my first day creating this project. I am very nervous because I am not sure if I understand what I am doing
                    and
                    I want to finish this as quickly as possible. Either way, I'm excited to start working and make some progress each
                    day
                </p>

            <p>Today don't have much time to work on the project, so I am going to try to
                just add a little to the site.html and site.css files and make a workable output
                with my flask file
            </p>
            <h5>Accomplishments Today</h5>
            <li>Added to site.html and site.css</li>
            <li>Reorganized Project structure</li>
            <li>Added basic score calculation functions in app.py</li>
            <li>Installed Jinja2 to add more functionality to html files by
                sending them a varible from my python file</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Goals for Next Time</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn more about Steam Web API</li>
                <li>Add basic steam user info to html page (doesn't have to function)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h4>3/27/25</h4>
            <p>Today I learned that I might not be able to just grab the wishlist data from
                users as easily as I wanted to. I originally thought the base Steam Web API's would allow it
                but with more research I have to go to alternate API's for this use case. Other than that, I 
                set up a connection between this project and github, created a place to deploy the project with 
                a domain, and set up a basic connection between site.html and page.html.
            </p>
            <h5>Accomplishments Today</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Connection to GitHub</li>
                <li>Connection to Netlify (deploy and domain)</li>
                <li>Basic html file connection</li>
                <li>Learned more about Steam Web API uses and put it on my google doc</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Goals for Next Time</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure domain is fully prepared and working</li>
                <li>Get basic Steam Web API to work</li>
                <li>Make connection between html files more complicated (button with fun formatting)</li>
            </ul>
